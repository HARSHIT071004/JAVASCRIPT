# JAVASCRIPT
90 DAYS CHALLENGE FOR JAVASCRIPT
This repository represents my dedicated 90‑day challenge to master JavaScript. It documents daily practice, hands‑on exercises, and learning progress, laying a strong foundation for the MERN stack journey.

## Structure

- Organized by day or topic for ease of navigation  
- Includes progressively complex topics—from basics to advanced concepts  
- Emphasis on consistency and depth to reinforce understanding

## Learning Objectives

- Build proficiency in JavaScript fundamentals  
- Understand deeper concepts like closures, asynchronous patterns, and DOM manipulation  
- Create a reliable foundation before moving to full-stack development

## Project Layout

## Repository Overview

This project is divided into several folders. Each folder focuses on a specific topic in JavaScript and includes well-commented code and examples for practice.

### Folder Breakdown

| Folder Name                | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| `.devcontainer/`           | Contains configuration files for container-based environments (like VS Code Dev Containers). Not essential for JavaScript concepts but helps set up a development environment. |
| `.github/`                 | GitHub Actions or issue templates can go here (workflow automation). Mostly infrastructure-related. |
| `01_basics/`               | Covers the basic syntax of JavaScript – variables, data types, operators, and expressions. Ideal for absolute beginners. |
| `02_basics/`               | Focuses on working with JSON and how JavaScript handles data formats. |
| `03_basics/`               | Builds logic with simple problems like string manipulation, number conversions, and beginner exercises. |
| `04_controlflowstatement/`| Teaches decision-making statements: `if-else`, `switch`, `ternary`. Crucial for understanding flow control. |
| `05_loops_statements/`     | Introduces iteration using `for`, `while`, and `do...while` loops. Includes use of `break` and `continue`. |
| `06_DOM/`                  | Basics of interacting with the webpage using JavaScript DOM API. You’ll learn to select, create, and modify HTML elements. |
| `07_Events/`               | Covers how JavaScript handles user interactions like clicks, keypresses, and mouse events. |
| `08_advancejs/`            | Introduces important concepts like closures, higher-order functions, promises, and `async/await`. |
| `10_funwithjs/`            | Small creative or logical problems using JavaScript to enhance problem-solving skills. |
| `11_classesandoopsjs/`     | Object-Oriented Programming concepts including classes, constructors, objects, inheritance, etc. |
